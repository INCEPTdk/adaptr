\arguments{
\item{arms}{character vector with unique names for the trial arms.}

\item{true_ys}{numeric vector specifying true outcomes (e.g., event
probabilities, mean values, etc.) for all trial \code{arms}.}

\item{fun_y_gen}{function, generates outcomes. See \code{\link[=setup_trial]{setup_trial()}}
\strong{Details} for information on how to specify this function.\cr
\strong{Note:} this function is called once during setup to validate its output
(with the global random seed restored afterwards).}

\item{fun_draws}{function, generates posterior draws. See \code{\link[=setup_trial]{setup_trial()}}
\strong{Details} for information on how to specify this function.\cr
\strong{Note:} this function is called up to three times during setup to
validate its output (with the global random seed restored afterwards).}

\item{start_probs}{numeric vector, allocation probabilities for each arm at
the beginning of the trial. The default (\code{NULL}) automatically generates
equal randomisation probabilities for each arm.}

\item{fixed_probs}{numeric vector, fixed allocation probabilities for each
arm. Must be either a numeric vector with \code{NA} for arms without fixed
probabilities and values between \code{0} and \code{1} for the other arms or \code{NULL}
(default), if adaptive randomisation is used for all arms or if one of the
special settings (\code{"sqrt-based"}, \code{"sqrt-based start"},
\code{"sqrt-based fixed"}, or \code{"match"}) is specified for \code{control_prob_fixed}
(described below).}

\item{min_probs}{numeric vector, lower threshold for adaptive allocation
probabilities; lower probabilities will be rounded up to these values. Must
be \code{NA} (default for all arms) if no lower threshold is wanted and for arms
using fixed allocation probabilities.}

\item{max_probs}{numeric vector, upper threshold for adaptive allocation
probabilities; higher probabilities will be rounded down to these values.
Must be \code{NA} (default for all arms) if no threshold is wanted and for arms
using fixed allocation probabilities.}

\item{data_looks}{vector of increasing integers, specifies when to conduct
adaptive analyses (= the total number of patients with available outcome
data at each adaptive analysis). The last number in the vector represents
the final adaptive analysis, i.e., the final analysis where superiority,
inferiority, practical equivalence, or futility can be claimed.
Instead of specifying \code{data_looks}, the \code{max_n} and \code{look_after_every}
arguments can be used in combination (in which case \code{data_looks} must be
\code{NULL}, the default value).}

\item{max_n}{single integer, number of patients with available outcome data
at the last possible adaptive analysis (defaults to \code{NULL}).
Must only be specified if \code{data_looks} is \code{NULL}. Requires specification of
the \code{look_after_every} argument.}

\item{look_after_every}{single integer, specified together with \code{max_n}.
Adaptive analyses will be conducted after every \code{look_after_every}
patients have available outcome data, and at the total sample size as
specified by \code{max_n} (\code{max_n} does not need to be a multiple of
\code{look_after_every}). If specified, \code{data_looks} must be \code{NULL} (default).}

\item{randomised_at_looks}{vector of increasing integers or \code{NULL},
specifying the number of patients randomised at the time of each adaptive
analysis, with new patients randomised using the current allocation
probabilities at said analysis.
If \code{NULL} (the default), the number of patients randomised at each analysis
will match the number of patients with available outcome data at said
analysis, as specified by \code{data_looks} or \code{max_n} and \code{look_after_every},
i.e., outcome data will be available immediately after randomisation for
all patients.\cr
If not \code{NULL}, the vector must be of the same length as the number of
adaptive analyses specified by \code{data_looks} or \code{max_n} and
\code{look_after_every}, and all values must be larger than or equal to the
number of patients with available outcome data at each analysis.}

\item{control}{single character string, name of one of the \code{arms} or \code{NULL}
(default). If specified, this arm will serve as a common control arm, to
which all other arms will be compared and the
inferiority/superiority/equivalence thresholds (see below) will be for
those comparisons. See \code{\link[=setup_trial]{setup_trial()}} \strong{Details} for information on
behaviour with respect to these comparisons.}

\item{control_prob_fixed}{if a common \code{control} arm is specified, this can
be set \code{NULL} (the default), in which case the control arm allocation
probability will not be fixed if control arms change (the allocation
probability for the first control arm may still be fixed using
\code{fixed_probs}). If not \code{NULL}, a vector of probabilities of either length
\code{1} or \verb{number of arms - 1} can be provided, or one of the special
arguments \code{"sqrt-based"}, \code{"sqrt-based start"}, \code{"sqrt-based fixed"} or
\code{"match"}. See \code{\link[=setup_trial]{setup_trial()}} \strong{Details} for details on how this affects
trial behaviour.}

\item{inferiority}{single numeric value or vector of numeric values of the
same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses, specifying
the probability threshold(s) for inferiority (default is \code{0.01}). All
values must be \verb{>= 0} and \verb{<= 1}, and if multiple values are supplied, no
values may be lower than the preceding value. If a common \code{control}is not
used, all values must be \verb{< 1 / number of arms}. An arm will be considered
inferior and dropped if the probability that it is best (when comparing all
arms) or better than the control arm (when a common \code{control} is used)
drops below the inferiority threshold at an adaptive analysis.}

\item{superiority}{single numeric value or vector of numeric values of the
same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses, specifying
the probability threshold(s) for superiority (default is \code{0.99}). All
values must be \verb{>= 0} and \verb{<= 1}, and if multiple values are supplied, no
values may be higher than the preceding value. If the probability that an
arm is best (when comparing all arms) or better than the control arm (when
a common \code{control} is used) exceeds the superiority threshold at an
adaptive analysis, said arm will be declared the winner and the trial will
be stopped (if no common \code{control} is used or if the last comparator is
dropped in a design with a common control) \emph{or} become the new control and
the trial will continue (if a common control is specified).}

\item{equivalence_prob}{single numeric value, vector of numeric values of the
same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses or \code{NULL}
(default, corresponding to no equivalence assessment), specifying the
probability threshold(s) for equivalence. If not \code{NULL}, all values must be
\verb{> 0} and \verb{<= 1}, and if multiple values are supplied, no value may be
higher than the preceding value. If not \code{NULL}, arms will be dropped for
equivalence if the probability of either \emph{(a)} equivalence compared to a
common \code{control} or \emph{(b)} equivalence between all arms remaining (designs
without a common \code{control}) exceeds the equivalence threshold at an
adaptive analysis. Requires specification of \code{equivalence_diff} and
\code{equivalence_only_first}.}

\item{equivalence_diff}{single numeric value (\verb{> 0}) or \code{NULL} (default,
corresponding to no equivalence assessment). If a numeric value is
specified, estimated absolute differences smaller than this threshold will
be considered equivalent. For designs with a common \code{control} arm, the
differences between each non-control arm and the \code{control} arm is used, and
for trials without a common \code{control} arm, the difference between the
highest and lowest estimated outcome rates are used and the trial is only
stopped for equivalence if all remaining arms are equivalent.}

\item{equivalence_only_first}{single logical in trial specifications where
\code{equivalence_prob} and \code{equivalence_diff} are specified and a common
\code{control} arm is included, otherwise \code{NULL} (default). If a common
\code{control} arm is used, this specifies whether equivalence will only be
assessed for the first control (if \code{TRUE}) or also for subsequent \code{control}
arms (if \code{FALSE}) if one arm is superior to the first control and becomes
the new control.}

\item{futility_prob}{single numeric value, vector of numeric values of the
same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses or \code{NULL}
(default, corresponding to no futility assessment), specifying the
probability threshold(s) for futility. All values must be \verb{> 0} and \verb{<= 1},
and if multiple values are supplied, no value may be higher than the
preceding value. If not \code{NULL}, arms will be dropped for futility if
the probability for futility compared to the common \code{control} exceeds the
futility threshold at an adaptive analysis. Requires a common \code{control}
arm (otherwise this argument must be \code{NULL}), specification of
\code{futility_diff}, and \code{futility_only_first}.}

\item{futility_diff}{single numeric value (\verb{> 0}) or \code{NULL} (default,
corresponding to no futility assessment). If a numeric value is specified,
estimated differences below this threshold in the \emph{beneficial} direction
(as specified in \code{highest_is_best}) will be considered futile when
assessing futility in designs with a common \code{control} arm. If only 1 arm
remains after dropping arms for futility, the trial will be stopped without
declaring the last arm superior.}

\item{futility_only_first}{single logical in trial specifications designs
where \code{futility_prob} and \code{futility_diff} are specified, otherwise \code{NULL}
(default and required in designs without a common \code{control} arm).
Specifies whether futility will only be assessed against the first
\code{control} (if \code{TRUE}) or also for subsequent control arms (if \code{FALSE}) if
one arm is superior to the first control and becomes the new control.}

\item{highest_is_best}{single logical, specifies whether larger estimates of
the outcome are favourable or not; defaults to \code{FALSE}, corresponding to,
e.g., an undesirable binary outcomes (e.g., mortality) or a continuous
outcome where lower numbers are preferred (e.g., hospital length of stay).}

\item{soften_power}{either a single numeric value or a numeric vector of
exactly the same length as the maximum number of looks/adaptive analyses.
Values must be between \code{0} and \code{1} (default); if \verb{< 1}, then re-allocated
non-fixed allocation probabilities are all raised to this power (followed
by rescaling to sum to \code{1}) to make adaptive allocation probabilities
less extreme, in turn used to redistribute remaining probability while
respecting limits when defined by \code{min_probs} and/or \code{max_probs}. If \code{1},
then no \emph{softening} is applied.}

\item{fun_raw_est}{function that takes a numeric vector and returns a
single numeric value, used to calculate a raw summary estimate of the
outcomes in each \code{arm}. Defaults to \code{\link[=mean]{mean()}}, which is always used in the
\code{\link[=setup_trial_binom]{setup_trial_binom()}} and \code{\link[=setup_trial_norm]{setup_trial_norm()}} functions.\cr
\strong{Note:} the function is called one time per arm during setup to validate
the output structure.}

\item{cri_width}{single numeric \verb{>= 0} and \verb{< 1}, the width of the
percentile-based credible intervals used when summarising individual trial
results. Defaults to \code{0.95}, corresponding to 95\% credible intervals.}

\item{n_draws}{single integer, the number of draws from the posterior
distributions for each arm used when running the trial. Defaults to
\code{5000}; can be reduced for a speed gain (at the potential loss of stability
of results if too low) or increased for increased precision (increasing
simulation time). Values \verb{< 100} are not allowed and values \verb{< 1000} are
not recommended and warned against.}

\item{robust}{single logical, if \code{TRUE} (default) the medians and median
absolute deviations (scaled to be comparable to the standard deviation for
normal distributions; MAD_SDs, see \code{\link[stats:mad]{stats::mad()}}) are used to summarise
the posterior distributions; if \code{FALSE}, the means and standard deviations
(SDs) are used instead (slightly faster, but may be less appropriate for
posteriors skewed on the natural scale).}

\item{description}{optional single character string describing the trial
design, will only be used in print functions if not \code{NULL} (the default).}

\item{add_info}{optional single string containing additional information
regarding the trial design or specifications, will only be used in print
functions if not \code{NULL} (the default).}
}
\value{
A \code{trial_spec} object used to run simulations by \code{\link[=run_trial]{run_trial()}} or

\description{
Specifies the design of an adaptive trial with any type of outcome and

\strong{Advanced example} vignette
(\code{vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")}).
}
\details{
\strong{How to specify the \code{fun_y_gen} function}

The function must take the following arguments:
\itemize{
\item \code{allocs}: character vector, the trial \code{arms} that new patients allocated
since the last adaptive analysis are randomised to.
}

The function must return a single numeric vector, corresponding to the
outcomes for all patients allocated since the last adaptive analysis, in the
same order as \code{allocs}.\cr
See the \strong{Advanced example} vignette
(\code{vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")}) for an example with
further details.

\strong{How to specify the \code{fun_draws} function}

The function must take the following arguments:
\itemize{
\item \code{arms}: character vector, the unique trial \code{arms}, in the same order as
above, but only the \strong{currently active} arms are included when the function
is called.
\item \code{allocs}: a vector of allocations for all patients, corresponding to the
trial \code{arms}, including patients allocated to both
\strong{currently active AND inactive} \code{arms} when called.
\item \code{ys}: a vector of outcomes for all patients in the same order as \code{allocs},
including outcomes for patients allocated to both
\strong{currently active AND inactive} \code{arms} when called.
\item \code{control}: single character, the current \code{control} arm, will be \code{NULL} for
designs without a common control arm, but required regardless as the argument
is supplied by \code{\link[=run_trial]{run_trial()}}/\code{\link[=run_trials]{run_trials()}}.
\item \code{n_draws}: single integer, the number of posterior draws for each arm.
}

The function must return a \code{matrix} (containing numeric values) with \code{arms}
named columns and \code{n_draws} rows. The \code{matrix} must have columns
\strong{only for currently active arms} (when called). Each row should contain a
single posterior draw for each arm on the original outcome
scale: if they are estimated as, e.g., the \emph{log(odds)}, these estimates must
be transformed to probabilities and similarly for other measures.\cr
Important: the \code{matrix} cannot contain \code{NA}s, even if no patients have been
randomised to an arm yet. See the provided example for one way to alleviate
this.\cr
See the \strong{Advanced examples} vignette
(\code{vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")}) for an example with
further details.

\emph{Notes}
\itemize{
\item Different estimation methods and prior distributions may be used;
complex functions will lead to slower simulations compared to simpler
methods for obtaining posterior draws, including those specified using the
\code{\link[=setup_trial_binom]{setup_trial_binom()}} and \code{\link[=setup_trial_norm]{setup_trial_norm()}} functions.
\item Technically, using log relative effect measures — e.g. log(odds ratios) or
log(risk ratios) - or differences compared to a reference arm (e.g., mean
differences or absolute risk differences) instead of absolute values in each
arm will work to some extent (\strong{be cautious!}):
\item Stopping for superiority/inferiority/max sample sizes will work.
\item Stopping for equivalence/futility may be used with relative effect
measures on the log scale, but thresholds have to be adjusted accordingly.
\item Several summary statistics from \code{\link[=run_trial]{run_trial()}} (\code{sum_ys} and posterior
estimates) may be nonsensical if relative effect measures are used
(depending on calculation method; see the \code{raw_ests} argument in the
relevant functions).
\item In the same vein, \code{\link[=extract_results]{extract_results()}} (\code{sum_ys}, \code{sq_err}, and
\code{sq_err_te}), and \code{\link[=summary]{summary()}} (\code{sum_ys_mean/sd/median/q25/q75/q0/q100},
\code{rmse}, and \code{rmse_te}) may be equally nonsensical when calculated on
the relative scale (see the \code{raw_ests} argument in the relevant functions.
}

\strong{Using additional custom or functions from loaded packages in the
custom functions}

If the \code{fun_y_gen}, \code{fun_draws}, or \code{fun_raw_est} functions calls other
user-specified functions (or uses objects defined by the user outside these
functions or the \code{\link[=setup_trial]{setup_trial()}}-call) or functions from external packages
and simulations are conducted on multiple cores, these objects or functions
must be exported or prefixed with their namespaces, respectively, as
described in \code{\link[=setup_cluster]{setup_cluster()}} and \code{\link[=run_trials]{run_trials()}}.

\strong{More information on arguments}
\itemize{
\item \code{control}: if one or more treatment arms are superior to the control arm
(i.e., passes the superiority threshold as defined above), this arm will
become the new control (if multiple arms are superior, the one with the
highest probability of being the overall best will become the new control),
the previous control will be dropped for inferiority, and all remaining arms
will be immediately compared to the new control in the same adaptive analysis
and dropped if inferior (or possibly equivalent/futile, see below) compared
to this new control arm. Only applies in trials with a common \code{control}.
\item \code{control_prob_fixed}: If the length is 1, then this allocation probability
will be used for the \code{control} group (including if a new arm becomes the
control and the original control is dropped). If multiple values are specified
the first value will be used when all arms are active, the second when one
arm has been dropped, and so forth. If 1 or more values are specified,
previously set \code{fixed_probs}, \code{min_probs} or \code{max_probs} for new control arms
will be ignored. If all allocation probabilities do not sum to 1 (e.g, due to
multiple limits) they will be rescaled to do so.\cr
Can also be set to one of the special arguments \code{"sqrt-based"},
\code{"sqrt-based start"}, \code{"sqrt-based fixed"} or \code{"match"} (written exactly as
one of those, case sensitive). This requires \code{start_probs} to be \code{NULL} and
relevant \code{fixed_probs} to be \code{NULL} (or \code{NA} for the control arm).\cr
If one of the \code{"sqrt-based"/"sqrt-based start"/"sqrt-based fixed"} options
are used, the function will set \emph{square-root-transformation-based} starting
allocation probabilities. These are defined as:\cr
\verb{square root of number of non-control arms to 1-ratio for other arms}\cr
scaled to sum to 1, which will generally increase power for comparisons
against the common \code{control}, as discussed in, e.g., \emph{Park et al, 2020}
\doi{10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.04.025}.\cr
If \code{"sqrt-based"}, square-root-transformation-based allocation probabilities
will also be used for new controls when arms are dropped. If
\code{"sqrt-based start"}, the control arm will be fixed to this allocation
probability at all times (also after arm dropping, with rescaling as
necessary, as specified above). If \code{"sqrt-based fixed"} is chosen,
square-root-transformation-based allocation probabilities will be used and
all allocation probabilities will be fixed throughout the trial (with
rescaling when arms are dropped).\cr
If \code{"match"} is specified, the control group allocation probability will
always be \emph{matched} to be similar to the highest non-control arm allocation
probability.
}

\strong{Superiority and inferiority}

In trial designs without a common control arm, superiority and inferiority
are assessed by comparing all \emph{\strong{currently active}} groups. This means that
if a "final" analysis of a trial without a common control and \verb{> 2 arms} is
conducted including all arms (as will often be done in practice) \emph{after} an
adaptive trial has stopped, the final probabilities of the best arm being
superior may differ slightly.\cr
For example, in a trial with three arms and no common \code{control} arm, one arm
may be dropped early for inferiority defined as \verb{< 1\%} probability of being
the overall best \code{arm}. The trial may then continue with the two remaining
arms, and stopped when one is declared superior to the other defined as
\verb{> 99\%} probability of being the overall best \code{arm}. If a final analysis is
then conducted including all arms, the final probability of the best arm
being overall superior will generally be slightly lower as the probability
of the first dropped arm being the best will often be \verb{> 0\%}, even if very
low and below the inferiority threshold.\cr
This is less relevant trial designs \emph{with} a common \code{control}, as pairwise
assessments of superiority/inferiority compared to the common \code{control} will
not be influenced similarly by previously dropped arms (and previously
dropped arms may be included in the analyses, even if posterior distributions
are not returned for those).
Similarly, in actual clinical trials and when \code{randomised_at_looks} is
specified with numbers higher than the number of patients with available
outcome data at each analysis, final probabilities may change somewhat when
the all patients are have completed follow-up and are included in a final
analysis.

\strong{Equivalence}

Equivalence is assessed \emph{\strong{after}} both inferiority and superiority have
been assessed (and in case of superiority, it will be assessed against the
new \code{control} arm in designs with a common \code{control}, if specified - see
above).

\strong{Futility}

Futility is assessed \emph{\strong{after}} inferiority, superiority, \emph{\strong{and}}
equivalence have been assessed (and in case of superiority, it will be
assessed against the new control arm in designs with a common control, if
specified - see above). Arms will thus be dropped for equivalence before
futility.

\strong{Varying probability thresholds}

Different probability thresholds (for superiority, inferiority, equivalence,
and futility) may be specified for different adaptive analyses. This may be
used, e.g., to apply more strict probability thresholds at earlier analyses
(or make one or more stopping rules not apply at earlier analyses), similar
to the use of monitoring boundaries with different thresholds used for
interim analyses in conventional, frequentist group sequential trial designs.
See the \strong{Basic examples} vignette
(\code{vignette("Basic-examples", package = "adaptr")}) for an example.
