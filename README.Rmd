The `adaptr` package simulates adaptive (multi-arm, multi-stage) clinical trials
using adaptive stopping, adaptive arm dropping and/or response-adaptive
randomisation.

The package has been developed as part of the
[INCEPT (Intensive Care Platform Trial) project](https://incept.dk/), primarily
supported by a grant from [Sygeforsikringen "danmark"](https://www.sygeforsikring.dk/).

## Installation

The easiest way is to install from CRAN directly:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("adaptr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the **development version** from GitHub - this
requires the *remotes*-package installed. The development version may contain
additional features not yet available in the CRAN version, but may not be stable
or fully documented:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("INCEPTdk/adaptr@dev")
```

## Usage and workflow overview

The central functionality of `adaptr` and the typical workflow is illustrated
here.

### Setup

First, the package is loaded and a cluster of parallel workers is initiated by
the `setup_cluster()` function to facilitate parallel computing:

```{r}
library(adaptr)

# Setup a cluster of parallel workers to be used as default
setup_cluster(2)
# Alternatively, a new cluster of workers may be initiated with each relevant
# function call using `options(mc.cores = <number>)` or the `cores` argument
```

### Specify trial design

Setup a trial specification (defining the trial design and scenario) using
the general `setup_trial()` function, or one of the special case variants using
default priors `setup_trial_binom()` (for binary, binomially distributed
outcomes; used in this example) or `setup_trial_norm()` (for continuous,
normally distributed outcomes).

```{r}
# Setup a trial using a binary, binomially distributed, undesirable outcome
binom_trial <- setup_trial_binom(
  arms = c("Arm A", "Arm B", "Arm C"),
  # Scenario with identical outcomes in all arms
  true_ys = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25),
  min_probs = rep(0.15, 3), # Minimum allocation of 15% in all arms
  # Number of patients with data available at each analysis
  data_looks = seq(from = 300, to = 2000, by = 100),
  # Number of patients randomised at each analysis (higher than the numbers
  # with data, except at last look, due to follow-up/data collection lag)
  randomised_at_looks = c(seq(from = 400, to = 2000, by = 100), 2000),
  # Stopping rules for inferiority/superiority not explicitly defined
  # Stop for equivalence at > 90% probability of differences < 5 %-points
  equivalence_prob = 0.9,
  equivalence_diff = 0.05,
  soften_power = 0.5 # Soften allocation ratios
)

# Print trial specification
print(binom_trial, prob_digits = 3)
```

### Calibration

In the example trial specification, there are no true between-arm differences,
and stopping rules for inferiority and superiority are not explicitly defined.
This is intentional, as these stopping rules will be calibrated to obtain a
desired probability of stopping for superiority in the scenario with no
between-arm differences, corresponding to the Bayesian type 1 error rate. Trial
specifications do not necessarily have to be calibrated, and simulations can be
run directly using the `run_trials()` function covered below (or `run_trial()`
for a single simulation).

Calibration of a trial specification is done using the `calibrate_trial()`
function, which defaults to calibrate constant, symmetrical stopping rules
for inferiority and superiority (expecting a trial specification with
identical outcomes in each arm), but can be used to calibrate any parameter in a
trial specification towards any performance metric.

```{r}
# Calibrate the trial specification
calibrated_binom_trial <- calibrate_trial(
  trial_spec = binom_trial,
  n_rep = 1000, # 1000 simulations for each step (more generally recommended)
  base_seed = 4131, # Base random seed (for reproducible results)
  target = 0.05, # Target value for calibrated metric (default value)
  search_range = c(0.9, 1), # Search range for superiority stopping threshold
  tol = 0.01, # Tolerance range
  dir = -1 # Tolerance range only applies below target
  # Results may be saved (and reloaded) if the 'path' argument is used
)

# Print result (to check if calibration is successful)
calibrated_binom_trial
```

The calibration is successful - the calibrated, constant stopping threshold for
superiority is printed with the results (`r calibrated_binom_trial$best_x`) and
can be extracted using `calibrated_binom_trial$best_x`. Using the default
calibration functionality, the calibrated, constant stopping threshold for
inferiority is symmetrical, i.e., `1 - stopping threshold for superiority`
(`r 1 - calibrated_binom_trial$best_x`). The calibrated trial specification
may be extracted using `calibrated_binom_trial$best_trial_spec` and, if printed,
will also include the calibrated stopping thresholds.

### Summarising results

The results of the simulations using the calibrated trial specification
conducted during the calibration procedure may be extracted using
`calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims`. These results can be summarised with several
functions. Most of these functions support different 'selection strategies' for
simulations not ending with superiority, i.e., performance metrics can be
calculated assuming different arms would be used in clinical practice if no arm
is ultimately superior.

The `check_performance()` function summarises performance metrics in a tidy
`data.frame`, with uncertainty measures (bootstrapped confidence intervals) if
requested:

```{r}
# Calculate performance metrics with uncertainty measures
binom_trial_performance <- check_performance(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims,
  # Select the remaining arm with highest probability of being overall best
  # in simulations not ending with superiority
  select_strategy = "best",
  uncertainty = TRUE, # Calculate uncertainty measures
  n_boot = 1000, # 1000 bootstrap samples (more typically recommended)
  ci_width = 0.95, # 95% confidence intervals (default)
  boot_seed = "base" # Use same random seed for bootstrapping as for simulations
)

# Print results 
print(binom_trial_performance, digits = 2)
```
Similar results in `list` format (without uncertainty measures) can be obtained
using the `summary()` method, which comes with a `print()` method providing
formatted results:

```{r}
binom_trial_summary <- summary(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims,
  select_strategy = "best" # As above
)

print(binom_trial_summary)
```

Individual simulation results may be extracted in a tidy `data.frame` using
`extract_results()`. Finally, the probabilities of different remaining arms and
their statuses (with uncertainty) at the last adaptive analysis can be
summarised using the `check_remaining_arms()` function (dropped arms will
be shown with an empty text string):
`

```{r}
check_remaining_arms(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims,
  ci_width = 0.95 # 95% confidence intervals (default)
)
```

### Visualising results

Several visualisation functions are included (all are optional, and all require
the `ggplot2` package installed).

Convergence and stability of performance metrics may be visually
assessed using `plot_convergence()` function:

```{r}
plot_convergence(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims,
  metrics = c("size mean", "prob_superior", "prob_equivalence"),
  # select_strategy can be specified here, but does not affect these metrics
)
```

The empirical cumulative distribution functions for continuous performance
metrics may also be visualised:

```{r}
plot_metrics_ecdf(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims, 
  metrics = "size"
)
```

The status probabilities for the overall trial (or for specific arms) according
to trial progress can be visualised using the `plot_status()` function:

```{r}
plot_status(
  calibrated_binom_trial$best_sims,
  x_value = "total n" # Total number of randomised patients at X-axis
)
```

Finally, various metrics may be summarised over the progress of one or multiple
trial simulations using the `plot_history()` function, which requires non-sparse
results (the `sparse` argument must be `FALSE` in `calibrate_trials()`,
`run_trials()`, or `run_trial()`, leading to additional results being saved).

### Use calibrated stopping thresholds in another scenario

The calibrated stopping thresholds (calibrated in a scenario with no between-arm
differences) may be used to run simulations with the same overall trial
specification, but according to a different scenario (i.e., between-arm
differences present) to assess performance metrics (including the Bayesian
analogues of power and type 2 error rates).

First, a new trial specification is setup using the same settings as before and
the calibrated stopping thresholds:

```{r}
binom_trial_calib_diff <- setup_trial_binom(
  arms = c("Arm A", "Arm B", "Arm C"),
  true_ys = c(0.25, 0.20, 0.30), # Different outcomes in the arms
  min_probs = rep(0.15, 3),
  data_looks = seq(from = 300, to = 2000, by = 100),
  randomised_at_looks = c(seq(from = 400, to = 2000, by = 100), 2000),
  # Stopping rules for inferiority/superiority explicitly defined
  # using the calibration results
  inferiority = 1 - calibrated_binom_trial$best_x,
  superiority = calibrated_binom_trial$best_x,
  equivalence_prob = 0.9,
  equivalence_diff = 0.05,
  soften_power = 0.5
)
```

Simulations using the trial specification with calibrated stopping thresholds
and differences present can then be conducted using the `run_trials()` function
and performance metrics calculated as above:

```{r}
binom_trial_diff_sims <- run_trials(
  binom_trial_calib_diff,
  n_rep = 1000, # 1000 simulations (more generally recommended)
  base_seed = 1234 # Reproducible results
  # Results may be saved (and reloaded) if the 'path' argument is used
)

check_performance(
  binom_trial_diff_sims,
  select_strategy = "best",
  uncertainty = TRUE,
  n_boot = 1000, # 1000 bootstrap samples (more typically recommended)
  ci_width = 0.95,
  boot_seed = "base"
)
```

Similarly, overall trial statuses for the scenario with differences are
visualised:

```{r}
plot_status(binom_trial_diff_sims, x_value = "total n")
```
