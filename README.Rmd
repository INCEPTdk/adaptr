The `adaptr` package simulates adaptive clinical trials using adaptive
stopping, adaptive arm dropping and/or response-adaptive randomisation.

The package has been developed as part of the
[INCEPT (Intensive Care Platform Trial) project](https://www.incept.dk), which
is primarily supported by a grant from
[Sygeforsikringen "danmark"](https://www.sygeforsikring.dk/).

## Installation

`adaptr` is not yet on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (but should be
shortly), but you can install the package directly from
[GitHub](https://github.com/INCEPTdk/adaptr/) using the
`remotes` package (install it with `install.packages("remotes")` if you do not
already have it):

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("INCEPTdk/adaptr")
```

## Example

The basic functionality of `adaptr` is illustrated below.

First, load the library and setup a trial specification using the general
`setup_trial()` function, or one of the special case functions,
`setup_trial_binom()` (used in the example) or `setup_trial_norm()`.

```{r}
library(adaptr)

# Setup a trial using a binary, binomially distributed, undesirable outcome
binom_trial <- setup_trial_binom(
  arms = c("Arm A", "Arm B", "Arm C"),
  true_ys = c(0.25, 0.20, 0.30),
  min_probs = rep(0.15, 3), # Minimum allocation of 15% in all arms
  data_looks = seq(from = 300, to = 2000, by = 100),
  # Stop for equivalence at > 90% probability of differences < 5 %-points
  equivalence_prob = 0.9,
  equivalence_diff = 0.05,
  soften_power = 0.5 # Soften allocation ratios
)

# Print trial specification
print(binom_trial, prob_digits = 3)
```

Simulate a single trial using a reproducible random seed:

```{r}
trial_res <- run_trial(binom_trial, seed = 12345)
print(trial_res, digits = 3)
```

Simulate multiple trials using a reproducible random seed:

```{r}
# Simulate multiple trials - only 10 simulations for speed in the example
trial_res_mult <- run_trials(binom_trial, n_rep = 10, base_seed = 67890)

# Extract results in a tidy data.frame (1 simulation per row)
# See function documentation for details, including on arm selection in trials
# not ending with a superior arm
extr_res <- extract_results(trial_res_mult)
head(extr_res)

# Summarise trial results
# See function documentation for details, including on arm selection in trials
# not ending with a superior arm
res_sum <- summary(trial_res_mult)
print(res_sum, digits = 1)
```

Plot trial statuses or history of trial metrics over time:

```{r plot, fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# Simulate multiple trials - 25 simulations only for speed
# sparse = FALSE is required for plot_history (but not plot_status)
trial_res_mult <- run_trials(binom_trial, n_rep = 25, base_seed = 67890, sparse = FALSE)

# Plot overall trial statuses according to the total number
# of patients randomised
plot_status(trial_res_mult, x_value = "total n")

# Plot allocation probabilities at each adaptive look (requires sparse = FALSE)
plot_history(trial_res_mult)
```

Plotting statuses for individual trial arms and other summary metrics is
possible, too.

## Issues and enhancements

We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/INCEPTdk/adaptr/issues) for
all bug/issue reports and proposals for enhancements. 

## Contributing

We welcome contributions directly to the code to improve performance as well
as new functionality. For the latter, please first explain and motivate it in an
[issue](https://github.com/INCEPTdk/adaptr/issues).

Changes to the code base should follow these steps:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository
- Make a branch with an appropriate name in your fork
- Implement changes in your fork, make sure it passes R CMD check (with neither
errors, warnings, nor notes) and add a bullet at the top of NEWS.md with a short
description of the change, your GitHub handle and the id of the pull request
implementing the change (check the `NEWS.md` file to see the formatting)
- Make a pull request into the `main` branch of `adaptr`
